This repository contains all datasets, analysis scripts, and documentation for the final project in Multivariate Analysis for Social Scientists at Università degli Studi di Milano.
The analysis investigates how different types of social ties, characterized by their support functions and multiplexity, relate to chronic health conditions, with a specific focus on racial disparities. Using data from the UCNets study (University of California, Berkeley), this project offers a preliminary exploration of whether networks of social support contribute to health inequalities across racial groups.
