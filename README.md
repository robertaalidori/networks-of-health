# networks-of-health
This repository contains all datasets, analysis scripts, and documentation for the final project in Multivariate Analysis for Social Scientists at Università degli Studi di Milano.
The analysis investigates how different types of social ties, characterized by their support functions and strain, relate to health conditions across race groups. Using data from the UCNets study (University of California, Berkeley), this project offers a preliminary exploration of whether networks of social support contribute to health inequalities across racial groups.

Data are available at: [ICPSR Study 36975](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36975)
